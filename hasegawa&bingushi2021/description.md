## The stereo matching network explains the reduction of binocular rivalry due to horizontal position and a disturbance of stereopsis.

Hasegawa, Y. & Bingushi, K. 2021 or 2022

There are four experiment.

#### exp1

Measured the cumulative disappearance times of monocular images in rivalry.

The bar in the left eye was suppressed by dots in the right eye spaced from endpoints of the bar.

The disparity between the bar and dots was manipulated in the cross direction as the independent variable: 0.0, 0.07, 0.15, 0.29 or 0.58 deg

One can rewrite "cross.csv" to change the disparity.


#### exp2

Measured the cumulative disappearance times of stereoscopic depth by rivalry.

The stereoscopic bars in eyes were separated 0.21 deg for B and K, and 0.14 deg for H.

The dots presented the right eye.

The disparity between the bar in the left eye and dots in the right eye was manipulated as the independent variable: −0.7, −0.42, −0.21, −0.14, 0.0, 0.14, 0.14, 0.21 or 0.42 deg, minus indicates crossed disparity.


### exp3

Measured the cumulative disappearance times of stereoscopic depth by rivalry.

The stereoscopic bars in eyes were separated 0.21 deg.

The dots rotated 90 deg from vertical and their distance coincided with distance of the bar's endpoints.

The centre of two dots was manipulated as the independent variable: coincided with position of the bar in the same eye or of the bar in the other eye.


### appended_exp

Measured the cumulative disappearance times of stereoscopic depth.

The stereoscopic bars in eyes were separated some disparity.
